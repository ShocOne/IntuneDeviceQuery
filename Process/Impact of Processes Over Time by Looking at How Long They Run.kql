Use Case: Identifying long-running processes with high resource utilization on a system for performance analysis and optimization.

Query:

Process
| project ProcessName, StartDateTime, ElapsedTimeInMinutes = ElapsedTimeMilliseconds / 60000, ThreadCount, HandleCount
| where ElapsedTimeInMinutes > 0 // Ensuring we only look at processes that have a reported elapsed time
| order by ElapsedTimeInMinutes desc, ThreadCount desc, HandleCount desc
